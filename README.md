**Dates:** May 20-21, 2024</br>
Hours: </br>
May 20th: 11:00-14:00</br>
May 21st: 14:00-17:00</br>

**Location**:
	Salerno University, Salerno, Italy

The Julia language, which was designed to address the typical challenges in computationally intensive data processing tasks.  Julia is like Python, in that it supports an efficient and convenient development process. At the same time, programs developed in Julia have performance comparable to C.

During this 2 day boot camp, you will learn how to program with Julia and how to connect your programs to external systems via web services, and how to use Julia to model and optimize system design.

This course does not require the participants to have any prior knowledge of Julia programming language. What we assume is an intermediate knowledge of any other language such as Python, C++ or R and a very basic understanding of concepts such as http protocol, system modelling and basics of statistics.

This course does not require the participants to have prior detailed knowledge of advanced machine learning algorithms nor the Julia programming language. What we assume is a basic knowledge of data science tools (like Python or R) and techniques (like linear regression, basic statistics, plotting).
